	<h1> Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, making them faster and more scalable.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the input size. It is often expressed using Big-O notation, such as O(n), to indicate the upper bound of memory usage.</p>
